###John Conway's Game of Life in Reflux###

[UPDATE] - I completed a more comprehensive version using Redux here: https://github.com/thepeted/game-of-life-redux

A barebones implementation of John Conway's Game of Life built with React and Reflux.

Read the rules of the game on the [Game of Life Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
